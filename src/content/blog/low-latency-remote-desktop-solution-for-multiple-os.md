If you manage multiple servers and desktops, be it your own home lab servers, gaming desktop or work computers or servers, the ideal solution to quickly and conveniently screen share with another computer running different OSes is hard to find. Even harder is to find a low latency remote desktop tool that works great.

Microsoft Remote Desktop is a pain by itself, it takes resources on the host, it's hard to configure and only works on Windows. Not to mention it's not available on Windows 11 Home edition.

VNC is the default connection tool for many server applications running an hypervisor like QEMU and similar to quickly see the display output of a virtual machine using a custom port for the connection. Most of the time copy & paste isn't available, the connection is slow and using it on a Mac is almost impossible. Macs offer a remote desktop facility to connect to other Macs. What if you wanted to screen share a Mac screen from Windows though?

## Meet Reemo. The low latency remote desktop tool.
I have been using [Reemo](https://reemo.io/?ref=garavelli.io) to screen share with a dozen different virtual machines running Linux and Windows 10, Windows Server 2022 and I'm amazed by the simple installation process, extremely low latency especially on local network and controls to adjust the bandwidth and remote host cpu usage.

Reemo is a paid product for companies that is free to use for individuals. I have in fact been using it for 3 months now to connect to a number of hosts that I run on TrueNas and never had a fault.

Deploy the remote client to the host and simply configure it by pasting a client ID string which ties that host to your account uniquely.

Job done. You can now connect from the Reemo dashboard to any of your hosts by simply clicking on it and the connection happens in the browser with the added convenience of installing the dashboard as web app in your computer for dock / start menu access.

Reemo also offers browser isolation tools and an API to integrate Reemo in your website.

[Starting at 19 USD](https://reemo.io/pricing?ref=garavelli.io) / month for enterprises and free to use for individuals this could be the go to solution for low latency remote desktop for gamers, system administrators and home lab owners.
